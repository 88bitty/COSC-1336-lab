A spaghetti sauce recipe calls for the following ingredients:
2 cups of tomato sauce, 1/3 cup of tomato paste (.333)
2 cloves garlic, 1 tablespoon oregano
The recipe produces 4 servings with these amounts of ingredients. 

Write a program that asks the user how many servings they want to make, then displays the amount
of each ingredient needed for the specified number of servings.

Geekware Software Company’s biggest seller software package sells for $149 each. Quantity discounts are
given according to the following table:

150 or more 40%

Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of packages purchased. If the number entered
is valid (not negative and not zero), the program should then display the dollar amount of the discount (if
any) and the total amount of the purchase after discount.
