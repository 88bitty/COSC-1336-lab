# COSC-1336-lab

These are the projects I have completed for the COSC-1336 course at ACC
(ordered by lab number)

A spaghetti sauce recipe calls for the following ingredients:
2 cups of tomato sauce, 1/3 cup of tomato paste (.333)
2 cloves garlic, 1 tablespoon oregano
The recipe produces 4 servings with these amounts of ingredients. 

Write a program that asks the user how many servings they want to make, then displays the amount
of each ingredient needed for the specified number of servings.

Geekware Software Company’s biggest seller software package sells for $149 each. Quantity discounts are
given according to the following table:
1-9 None
10-49 10%
50-99 20%
100-149 30%
150 or more 40%

Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of packages purchased. If the number entered
is valid (not negative and not zero), the program should then display the dollar amount of the discount (if
any) and the total amount of the purchase after discount.

4.1 -

Assuming the ocean’s level is currently rising at about 1.2 millimeters per year, create a program that
displays the number of millimeters that the ocean will have risen each year for the next 30 years.

4.2 - 

Write program that asks the user to enter the amount that he or she has budgeted for a month. Using
a while loop, the user should be prompted to enter each of his or her expenses for the month and keep a
running total. The loop should finish when the user enters 0. When the loop finishes, the program should
display the amount that the user is over budget (if any)

5.1 -

A restaurant receives numeric scores of 0-10 from five different food critics. A higher score means a
better rating. The average score translates into a 1-5 star rating.
Write Python program that has two functions, main and determine_stars. The main function should
accept input of five numeric ratings from the user using a loop. It should then calculate the average numeric
score for the restaurant. The numeric average should be passed to the determine_stars function that
displays the number of stars based on the numeric average

5.2 -

When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to determine the
distance the object falls in a specific time period:
d = ½ gt2
The variables in the formula are as follows:
d is the distance in meters
g is 9.8 m/s2
(the gravitational constant)
t is the amount of time in seconds the object has been falling
Your program will calculate the distance in meters based on the object’s falling time.
